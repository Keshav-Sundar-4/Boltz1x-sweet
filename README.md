# Boltz1x-sweet

## Introduction
Boltz-1x Sweet is a modified version of the Boltz-1x model that predicts glycoprotein and lectin-glycan interactions with high accuracy and precision. The program consisted of changes to major parts of the Boltz training piplein + the addition of novel architectural pieces. This work is currently in progress, with preliminary results attached below. These results are based on the first phase of training - the benchmarks are based on a select list of glycoproteins and lectins that make up a diverse benchmark
